Requires [SFML 2.1](http://www.sfml-dev.org).

## Building
To build:

	./configure

	profit!

This little program should compile just fine on OSX and Linux. Enjoy!

## Notes
* [SFML supported audio formats](https://github.com/LaurentGomila/SFML/wiki/FAQ#wiki-audio-formats)
* Don't panic if you see it say "Could not reach update server..."! The version checking code does not currently work completely. I'll be finishing it up over the course of winter break.
